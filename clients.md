Capital Technology Services Now in Philadelphia and Nashville
=============================================================

My wife and I are just finishing up the major work of our move to Philadelphia
and are getting settled into our new home. We have utilities connected, and are
only awaiting delivery of a new couch, that's when we'll finally feel back to
normal.

Now that I will be based primarily in Pennsylvania, and an occasional visitor to
Nashville on business I wanted to share content that will be on our web site
very soon. Our new client onboarding documentation has two very important steps,
making sure every stakeholder in your organization has a Github.com account and
a #Slack account.

Most everyone has already completed these two steps and sent us back their
Github.com username. This is the singular most important step in our new
onboarding documentation. All of the members of your organization that need
updates on our progress should have an account so that we can add them to the
relevant client "team".

Second, we're trying out #Slack as our virtual office solution. It allows us to
chat, receive notifications from our hosting services and infrastructure,
launch video conferences, and more. We're going to invite you to join us on so
that we can continue to hold weekly project planning meetings on #Slack.

Finally, thank you so much for your business. We hope that the past year and a
half has led to significant improvement in your projects and we're hoping to
implement better tools for garnering feedback on what your priorities and needs
are on a week to week basis. We still have developers in Nashville at The
Skillery on 6th Avenue North and I'll be at our new home at CityCoHo in Center
City in Philadelphia.

Client Onboarding
-----------------

1. Have all stakeholders in the project from your organization sign up for a Github.com account.

    1. [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank"}

    1. You do not have to select a paid Github plan, you just have to create a personal account.

        1. You can elect to create a paid plan later if necessary.

        1. We encourage that if you do create a paid plan for hosting your project, you create an, "organization" account along with "personal" accounts for all of your team members.

    1. Send all stakeholder e-mail addresses and Github account names to [john@cts-llc.net](mailto:john@cts-llc.net?subject=Client Onboarding).

1. You will be getting an invite to Slack, our virtual office / conferencing solution, accept this invitation and create an account.

Why is Github important?
------------------------

Github is the definitive system of record for tracking issues in your project.
Whether an issue is a specification for a brand new feature or a bug report,
"If you get it in Github, we're going to get it done."

Fewer bottlenecks
=================

While e-mail is a great communication tool, Github issues are visible to the
entire team working on your project. That means an issue or a specification
written in Github may be able to be addressed faster and with less expense than
issues you e-mail to an individual team member.

Github issues mean business
===========================

Team members at CTS get a lot of e-mail. Some of it has very little to do with
work, and some of it is downright junk. Make sure that your ideas and
concerns are given special consideration by collecting as much information as
possible about your idea or problem and file an issue.

Better organization
===================

We have the ability to schedule issues, label issues, and assign issues. Those
are three things you cannot do with an e-mail. When it comes to keeping us
organized Github is great!

\#Slack is our virtual office
-----------------------------

Now that CTS team members are two different time zones and cities, we needed a
virtual office. A place where you can find your team during business hours,
launch conferences, and get updates on your project. #Slack is the place where
that happens.
