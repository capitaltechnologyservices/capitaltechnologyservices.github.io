Client Onboarding
-----------------

1. Have all stakeholders in the project from your organization sign up for a Github.com account.

    1. [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank"}

    1. You do not have to select a paid Github plan, you just have to create a personal account.

        1. You can elect to create a paid plan later if necessary.

        1. We encourage that if you do create a paid plan for hosting your project, you create an, "organization" account along with "personal" accounts for all of your team members.

    1. Send all stakeholder e-mail addresses and Github account names to [john@cts-llc.net](mailto:john@cts-llc.net?subject=Client Onboarding).

1. You will be getting an invite to Slack, our virtual office / conferencing solution, accept this invitation and create an account.

Why is Github important?
------------------------

Github is the definitive system of record for tracking issues in your project.
Whether an issue is a specification for a brand new feature or a bug report,
"If you get it in Github, we're going to get it done."

Fewer bottlenecks
=================

While e-mail is a great communication tool, Github issues are visible to the
entire team working on your project. That means an issue or a specification
written in Github may be able to be addressed faster and with less expense than
issues you e-mail to an individual team member.

Github issues mean business
===========================

Team members at CTS get a lot of e-mail. Some of it has very little to do with
work, and some of it is downright junk. Make sure that your ideas and
concerns are given special consideration by collecting as much information as
possible about your idea or problem and file an issue.

Better organization
===================

We have the ability to schedule issues, label issues, and assign issues. Those
are three things you cannot do with an e-mail. When it comes to keeping us
organized Github is great!

\#Slack is our virtual office
-----------------------------

Now that CTS team members are two different time zones and cities, we needed a
virtual office. A place where you can find your team during business hours,
launch conferences, and get updates on your project. #Slack is the place where
that happens.
