    <p>Developers and partner organizations working with us will either be bound by a contract agreement provided by that entity or organization, or one that we provide. In the event that you’re an independent contractor working with us on a particular project, here’s the Independent Contractor Agreement that we usually issue.</p>

<p>THIS AGREEMENT executed on this the July 15th, 2016, but
agreed to be effective from and after July 15th, 2016, by
and between Capital Technology Services (Registered as Chapin Technology Service LLC) (hereinafter “Company”), and
YOUR NAME (hereinafter “Contractor”). NOW, THEREFORE,
FOR AND IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual promises and agreements contained herein,
Company hires Contractor, and Contractor agrees to work for Company under the
terms and conditions hereby agreed upon by the parties:</p>

<h2 id="work-to-be-performed">1. Work to be Performed</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Term.</strong> Company agrees to hire Contractor, at will, for a term commencing on
July 15th, 2016 and continuing until terminated in
accordance with Section 4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Duties.</strong> Contractor agrees to perform work for the Company on the terms
and conditions set forth in this agreement, and agrees to devote all
necessary time and attention (reasonable periods of illness accepted) to the
performance of the duties specified in this agreement.  Contractor’s duties
shall be as follows: planning, implementation, quality assurance,
deployment, documentation, project management, and tasks necessary for
environment maintenance for custom software development.  Contractor further
agrees that in all such aspects of such work, Contractor shall comply with
the policies, standards, regulations of the Company from time to time
established, and shall perform the duties assigned faithfully,
intelligently, to the best of their ability, and in the best interest of
the Company.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="confidentiality">2. Confidentiality</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> Contractor acknowledges and agrees that all financial
and accounting records, lists of property owned by Company, including
amounts paid therefore, client and customer lists, and other Company data
and information related to its business (hereinafter collectively
“Confidential Information”) are valuable assets of the Company. Except for
disclosures required to be made to advance the business of the Company and
information which is a matter of public record, Contractor shall not, during
the term of this Agreement or after the termination of this Agreement,
disclose any Confidential Information to any person or use any Confidential
Information for the benefit of Contractor or any other person, except with
the prior written consent of the Company.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Return of Documents.</strong> Contractor acknowledges and agrees that all
originals and copies of records, reports, documents, lists, plans,
memoranda, notes and other documentation related to the business of the
Company or containing any Confidential Information shall be the sole and
exclusive property of the Company, and shall be returned to the Company upon
the termination of this Agreement or upon the written request of the
Company.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ownership of Work Product.</strong> The Services and all deliverables and other
work product developed by Contractor in the performance of the Services,
including all intellectual property, moral and other proprietary rights
therein (collectively, “Work Product”) are a “work made for hire,” and shall
be solely owned by the Company. Contractor’s work has been specially ordered
by the Company.  Contractor’s work is derivative of the Company’s previous
work and merely a contribution to the Company’s collective work.  The
Company is the sole author of the Services, its contents, and any work
embodying or derived from any portion of the Services.  The Company is also
the owner of all the intellectual property related to the Services,
including but not limited to all technology, inventions, discoveries,
improvements, copyrightable works, ideas, applications for patents, patents
and trademarks related to the Services (collectively, the “Intellectual
Property”).  To the extent that the Services or any Work Product created by
Contractor, its agents or employees in the delivery of the Services are not
properly characterized as “work made for hire,” or to the extent that the
Work Product incorporates any pre-existing intellectual property of
Contractor prior to the date of this Agreement, then Contractor will, and
hereby does, grant The Company a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual,
irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable
license to use, modify, copy and distribute such intellectual property.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Injunction.</strong> Contractor agrees that it would be difficult to measure
damage to the Company from any breach by Contractor of Section 2.1 or 2.2
and that monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy for such breach. 
Accordingly, Contractor agrees that if Contractor shall breach Section 2.1
or 2.2, the Company shall be entitled to, in addition to all other remedies
it may have at law or equity, to an injunction or other appropriate orders
to restrain any such breach, without showing or proving actual damages
sustained by the Company.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No Release.</strong> Contractor agrees that the termination of this Agreement
shall not release Contractor from any obligations under Section 2.1, 2.2, or
2.3.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="compensation">3. Compensation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Compensation.</strong> In consideration of all services to be rendered by
Contractor to the Company, the Company shall pay to the Contractor based on
number of hours worked multiplied by the current rate of the applicable
staff member on the Contractor’s rate schedule. A copy of the current rate
schedule is attached to this document.  Said compensation shall be paid on a
monthly basis with the balance of invoices due within 30 days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Withholding; Other Benefits.</strong> Compensation paid pursuant to this
Agreement shall not subject to the customary withholding of income taxes
and other employment taxes.  Contractor shall be solely responsible for
reporting and paying any such taxes. The Company shall not provide
Contractor with any coverage or participation in the Company’s accident and
health insurance, life insurance, disability income insurance, medical
expense reimbursement, wage continuation plans, or other fringe benefits
provided to regular employees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Expenses.</strong> Company shall reimburse Contractor all reasonable and
necessary expenses incurred by Contractor in connection with the performance
of his duties hereunder, provided, the President or Managing Director of the
Company has approved such expenses in advance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="termination">4. Termination</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Termination at Will.</strong> This Agreement may be terminated by the Company
immediately, at will, and in the sole discretion of the President of the
Company. Contractor may terminate this Agreement upon fourteen (14) days
written notice to the Company. This Agreement also may be terminated at
any time upon the mutual written agreement of the Company and Contractor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Death.</strong> In the event Contractor dies during the term of this Agreement,
this Agreement shall terminate, and the Company shall pay to Contractor’s
estate the salary which would otherwise be payable to Contractor.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="independent-contractor-status">5. Independent Contractor Status</h2>

<p>Contractor acknowledges that they are an independent contractor and is not an
agent, partner, joint venturer or employee of Company.  Contractor shall have no
authority to bind or otherwise obligate Contractor in any manner nor shall
Contractor represent to anyone that it has a right to do so.  Contractor
further agrees that in the event that the Company suffers any loss or damage as
a result of a violation of this provision Contractor shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company for any such loss or damage.</p>

<h2 id="representations-of-warranties-of-contractor">6. Representations of Warranties of Contractor</h2>

<p>Contractor represents and warrants to the Company that there is no employment
contract or other contractual obligation to which Contractor is subject which
prevents Contractor from entering into this Agreement or from performing fully
Contractor’s duties under this Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous-provisions">7. Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and enured to the
benefit of the heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of
the parties. Any provision hereof which imposes upon Contractor or Company
an obligation after termination or expiration of this Agreement shall
survive termination or expiration hereof and be binding upon Contractor or
Company.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of a default under this Agreement, the defaulted party shall
reimburse the non-defaulting party or parties for all costs and expenses
reasonably incurred by the non-defaulting party or parties in connection
with the default, including without limitation, attorney’s fees.
Additionally, in the event a suit or action is filed to enforce this
Agreement or with respect to this Agreement, the prevailing party or parties
shall be reimbursed by the other party for all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the suit or action, including without limitation,
reasonable attorney’s fees at the trial level and on appeal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall
constitute, a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor
shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.  No waiver shall be binding
unless executed in writing by the party making the waiver.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and shall be construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Tennessee.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
pertaining to its subject matter and it supersedes all prior contemporaneous
agreements, representations and understandings of the parties.  No
supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding
unless executed in writing by all parties.</p>
