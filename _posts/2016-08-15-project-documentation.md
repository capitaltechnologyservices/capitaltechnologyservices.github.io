  This article describes the types of documentation that need to accompany each
  project we're involved with and standards to which that documentation must
  conform.

{{ page.excerpt }}

There are four types of documentation that we need to be concerned with:

1.  User Manual - a manual for the broader user base of the application.
1.  Administration Manual - a manual for project owners on how to care for the
    product. This includes documentation for devops and system administrators
    that will be caring for the supporting infrastructure.
1.  API / Developer Manual - This manual will be produced when the product
    features the ability for third party developers to integrate our product
    into their products. This is produced in addition to product documentation
    written in the source code of the product.
1.  Product Documentation - Documentation integrated into the source code of
    the product.
