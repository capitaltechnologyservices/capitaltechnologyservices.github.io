  Starting a new project, a new company, or working with a new tool is exciting.
  But few of us can afford for that initial excitement to turn into irrational
  exuberance. If you're founding a new startup or adopting a new technology you
  could benefit from asking yourself eight questions from a former DARPA
  director.

Last month I checked out Sharon Weinberger's *<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385351798/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385351798&linkCode=as2&tag=cts098-20&linkId=f94abc52b8220ff23b37741f2de5e214">The Imagineers of War: The Untold Story of DARPA, the Pentagon Agency That Changed the World</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cts098-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0385351798" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />* from the
Philadelphia Free Library. The book details the history of the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) from its early participation in the U.S. space
program, through the development of packet networking, and today's advances in
autonomous robots and artificial intelligence. I was personally interested in
how the book described the transformation of the agency's culture and processes.
In particular a set of eight questions from DARPA Director (1975-1977) George H.
Heilmeier caught my attention. The questions known as, "The Heilmeier Catechism"
are an excellent tool for evaluating the risks involved with any new venture.
Here is the complete list of questions:

## The Heilmeier Catechism

1.  What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no
    jargon.
1.  How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
1.  What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
1.  Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
1.  What are the risks?
1.  How much will it cost?
1.  How long will it take?
1.  What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?

## What's Important About Each of The Heilmeier Catechism's Questions

1.  What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no
    jargon.

    The most appealing part of this question might actually be the appended
    statement prohibiting jargon. When you describe a project as a, "responsive
    e-commerce presence that sells consumer packaged goods to customers adhering
    to a plant-based diet", you're limiting your audience. Alternatively,
    you could describe the project as, "a mobile friendly website for selling
    vegan snacks and dietary supplements". The second description is
    simple, compelling, and would be understood by someone not in the consumer
    packaged goods industry who also happens to be a vegan web developer. This
    is important because at some point you're going to need help from people
    outside of the industry in which you're operating (i.e. finance). Keep in
    mind that Heilmeier's Catechism was developed to help determine the risk
    level of a project before DARPA **funded** a project. Make the intention of
    your project clear and you're more likely to have someone invest in or pay
    for your work.

    Additionally, a lot of the unnecessary jargon in mission statements becomes
    a point of contention in the life of a project. What is a,
    "transformational" experience in social media photo sharing? The word
    transformational adds absolutely no information to a project's description
    because everyone has their own opinion about what would be transformational
    in the world of social media photo sharing.

1.  How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

    Answering this question is about understanding your competition and how they
    operate. The question itself seems fairly simple to understand. But the
    level of detail that people go to in their analysis is often lacking and
    frequently the second half of the question isn't considered at all.

    Entrepreneurs often end up focusing on the size of the market that they want
    to enter. For example, mobile app development may look like an amazing
    market with billions of dollars being spent on it and no sign of decreasing
    demand. Who wouldn't want to get in and compete for a piece of a market so
    big?! But when the analysis stops at concentrating on the astronomical sums
    of money at stake in a particular industry there's a considerable blind
    spot that is left unaddressed. A case needs to be made for improving the
    industry or attacking a vulnerability within it. There also needs to be an
    explanation of why competitors within an industry are not addressing the
    limitations or vulnerabilities. When you understand that, your answer to
    this question will be complete.

1.  What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

    Very few people have difficulty describing their approach to solving a
    problem. However, articulating why the solution is going to be compelling to
    stakeholders and potential customers is a weakness that

    Additionally, a lot of entrepreneurs end up misinterpreting a strength of
    the industry as a weakness. In mobile app development the release of new
    devices and operating systems may be what's propping up the market and
    making it profitable. If your plan is to somehow reduce the need for
    continual updates to keep up with mobile operating systems, you may be
    devising a plan that eliminates the protective moat around an industry

1.  Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?

1.  What are the risks?

1.  How much will it cost?

    Not understanding how to answer this question correctly is how projects most
    frequently meet their death.

    Stop looking at technology development as a one time capital investment in
    a very durable product. Start looking at technology development as
    investment in an asset that should be durable, but will have outside forces
    acting on it over its lifetime and depending on its environment. Significant
    ongoing maintenance is a possible necessity. In that way, investing in
    technology is often less like buying a shovel, and more frequently similar
    to buying a house, or possibly even livestock. A strange set of analogies I
    know, but allow me to explain. Look at the following three cases:

    When software development is like buying a shovel:

    We have a long standing client that engaged us to build an internal records
    system almost ten years ago. The system is only used internally and the
    requirements are simple, log data and allow the export of that data at the
    end of the month for billing. The application isn't publicly accessible and
    is hosted in an environment that does not expose it to the public Internet.
    We improve this application only when there is a requirement from the client
    to update the functionality of the application. We still monitor the
    application for reported vulnerabilities when we build the software nightly.
    But the software isn't subject to a number of outside stresses of an
    application being used by thousands to millions of users on the public
    Internet. There are no API integrations with outside services, and very few
    dependencies in the application. Dependencies are reliance upon third party
    programming libraries or outside services/resources that may change or be
    updated for a number of reasons, necessitating an update of your project as
    well.

    When software development is like buying a building:

    Another client that we work with has a system that we built two years ago.
    Like the internal records keeping system it is only used by a select group
    of users internally. However, the system is accessible over the Internet so
    we need to be more concerned when vulnerabilities are reported for this
    application. It would get attention before the internal records system of
    our other client. The application also integrates with three separate
    sources of data. One is a custom application programming interface, and two
    are RSS feeds, which have a very well specified standard with a lot of third
    party libraries to ease their consumption. If the feeds to this application
    change or are unavailable, then we need to be ready to respond to the
    lacking of information from that feed. The system has more dependencies upon
    third party libraries. It's connections with the outside world are mandatory
    and it cannot be sheltered from potential changes in those connections. So
    unlike your, "shovel" of an application you're dealing with a project that
    cannot be completely sheltered from the outside world. In that sense, it is
    more like a building that cannot be fully sheltered from the weather around
    it.

    When software development is like buying livestock:



    Too many entrepreneurs leave the answer of this question up to their
    workforce. They ask for estimates from one set of contractors or employees
    and those estimates are sometimes taken as the final word in what fielding
    a new project is going to cost.

1.  How long will it take?

1.  What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?
