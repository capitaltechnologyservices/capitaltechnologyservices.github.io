Web-based applications and services are at the heart of any company's Internet
operations. Nearly all mobile, desktop, and wearable applications send to or
consume data from APIs, and the administration of that data occurs via a web
browser. That is why we have chosen to make web-based application development
of our core service. Web apps are the linchpin of modern businesses.

Working with a company that specializes in web-application development means
that what should be your most essential software won't be ignored in favor of
more visible client applications. Many development companies cut corners and
divide their time while working on administration tools alongside mobile
software. We do not. Working with a company that has invested the time to
understand and improve the languages, software, and processes they use saves
money and lowers risk. Where other developers may use your project as an
opportunity to experiment with bleeding edge technology and train themselves at
your expense, we will not. We believe that our depth of experience and our
familiarity with our tools are the primary reason you should do business with
us. We don't pursue a line of business or a project when we are not confident in
our ability to bring value to our clients. We're not a software development
company that's interested in selling you marketing services, and you shouldn't
engage a marketing company to develop software either. When a skill outside of
our area of expertise is needed, we partner with organizations that specialize
in mobile development, marketing, and consult in a variety of vertical and
horizontal markets.

Work with us, and we will ensure that your web-based software and APIs will be
well engineered, thoroughly tested, and properly monitored.

  many other computing platforms. We've worked with everything from mainframes
  to mobile.

Our Clients: No Two Alike
-------------------------

Our consultants have worked with small businesses, startups, health care
organizations, local, state, and federal government agencies. The
stakeholders we have worked with have unique requirements and concerns, but our
process and philosophy remains the same no matter the project. We iteratively
build, test, and improve our client's projects using data and research to make
decisions whenever possible.

<h4>
  All of our clients benefit from our processes which are designed to lower risk
  and cost.
</h4>

Our Goal: Simple, Fast, and Profitable
--------------------------------------

Building a complicated system takes time. We want to build the simplest form of
the product that delivers the highest value for our customer and have them start
using it as soon as possible. We like to write clear, well tested code and
deploy to infrastructure that guarantees the performance, security, and
redundancy of the project.

<h4>
  Complicated can wait. We want our work to cut expenses or increase your
  income in short order. Your bottom line is the most important metric when it
  comes to measuring our success.
</h4>

Consultants in Nashville, TN and Philadelphia, PA
-------------------------------------------------

Nashville is our home town and Philadelphia is our newest outpost. Our lead
consultant is based in Philadelphia. Nashville is where the majority of our
Ruby on Rails developers are based, along with account and project management
staff. We love our cities and their traditions, particularly hot chicken and
roast pork sandwiches.

Contact us and we will find time to meet with you in person to discuss your
project. We don't charge for an initial consultation to determine the scope of
your project and if we can be of service. If you do want to engage our services
we typically offer time and materials and fixed periodic budget agreements.
All payment terms are net-30, cash, check, Visa, MasterCard, American Express,
and other major credit cards.
