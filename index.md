Web-based applications and services are the backbone of Internet companies.
Nearly all mobile, desktop, and wearable applications send to or consume data
from software residing on the Internet. That's why you can't risk working with
vendors who treat the the most critical components of your project as an
afterthought. The team at Capital Technology Services doesn't chase trends, we
build well engineered and tested back ends.

<h4>
  We work in Ruby and PHP, but have developed software projects that connect to
  many other computing platforms. We've worked with everything from mainframes
  to mobile.

Our Clients: No Two Alike
=========================

Our consultants have worked with small businesses, startups, health care
organizations, local, state, and federal government agencies. All of the
stakeholders we have worked with have unique requirements and concerns, but our
process and philosophy remains the same no matter the project. We iteratively
build, test, and improve our client's projects bringing data to bear whenever
possible in making decisions.

<h4>
  Our well defined and constantly improving processes lower your risk and lower
  your cost.

Software Engineering Consulting Redefined as ART
------------------------------------------------

Audit, Rescue, and Tune are our key services. We audit software products and
development teams and deliver suggestions on how to improve the product and the
processes used to create it. We rescue products in crisis and establish new
operating guidelines for stakeholders and developers. We tune applications to
deliver their promised functionality more expediently and efficiently.

Technologies, Methodologies, and Philosophies
---------------------------------------------

We practice Agile software development, taking lessons from the Agile Unified
Process, Rational Unified Process, and Scrum.

We are well versed in JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap 2.x & 3.x for client
side UI/UX development.

Server side languages and frameworks that we support include Ruby (Ruby on Rails
and Sinatra) and PHP (Zend Framework 1.x).

Hosting providers and cloud platforms that we work with include Amazon Web
Services (S3, Route53, CloudFront, RDS, and more), Heroku, and Rackspace
(Cloud Sites, Servers, and Storage).

Our favorite operating systems include OS X, Red Hat Linux, Debian GNU/Linux,
and Ubuntu. Additionally we provide consultation for Apache, nginx, and MySQL
