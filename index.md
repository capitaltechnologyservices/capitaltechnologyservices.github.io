Web-based applications and services are the backbone of Internet companies.
Nearly all mobile, desktop, and wearable applications send to or consume data
from software residing on the Internet. That's why you can't risk working with
vendors who treat the the most critical components of your project as an
afterthought. The team at Capital Technology Services doesn't chase trends, we
build well engineered and tested back ends.

<h4>
  We work in Ruby and PHP, but have developed software projects that connect to
  many other computing platforms. We've worked with everything from mainframes
  to mobile.
</h4>

Our Clients: No Two Alike
=========================

Our consultants have worked with small businesses, startups, health care
organizations, local, state, and federal government agencies. All of the
stakeholders we have worked with have unique requirements and concerns, but our
process and philosophy remains the same no matter the project. We iteratively
build, test, and improve our client's projects bringing data to bear whenever
possible in making decisions.

<h4>
  Our well defined and constantly improving processes lower your risk and lower
  your cost.
</h4>

Our Goal: Simple, Fast, and Profitable
======================================

Building a complicated system takes time. We want to build the simplest form of
the product that delivers the highest value for our customer and have them start
using it as soon as possible. We like to write clear, well tested code and
deploy to infrastructure that guarantees the performance, security, and
redundancy of the project.

<h4>
  Complicated can wait. We want our work to cut expenses or increase your
  income in short order. Your bottom line is the most important metric when it
  comes to measuring our success.
