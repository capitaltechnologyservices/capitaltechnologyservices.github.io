Clients: Small, Medium, and Large
---------------------------------

Small businesses, startups, health care organizations, local, state, and federal
government all develop software for their unique operational needs. We have
development and consulting experience with clients in each of these domains.
Our approach is similar with every client. We build an iterative development
process that minimizes risk while delivering product improvements every single
week.

Software Engineering Consulting Redefined as ART
------------------------------------------------

Audit, Rescue, and Tune are our key services. We audit software products and
development teams and deliver suggestions on how to improve the product and the
processes used to create it. We rescue products in crisis and establish new
operating guidelines for stakeholders and developers. We tune applications to
deliver their promised functionality more expediently and efficiently.

Technologies, Methodologies, and Philosophies
---------------------------------------------

We practice Agile software development, taking lessons from the Agile Unified
Process, Rational Unified Process, and Scrum.

We are well versed in JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap 2.x & 3.x for client
side UI/UX development.

Server side languages and frameworks that we support include Ruby (Ruby on Rails
and Sinatra) and PHP (Zend Framework 1.x).

Hosting providers and cloud platforms that we work with include Amazon Web
Services (S3, Route53, CloudFront, RDS, and more), Heroku, and Rackspace
(Cloud Sites, Servers, and Storage).

Our favorite operating systems include OS X, Red Hat Linux, Debian GNU/Linux,
and Ubuntu. Additionally we provide consultation for Apache, nginx, and MySQL
servers on Linux and *nix based operating systems.
